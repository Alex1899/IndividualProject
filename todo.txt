NEW IDEA:
1) count repetitions, identified minima points
2) provide analysis of each repetition, of the whole movement 


TODO
BICEP:
1) can detect if the hips are thrown forward/backwards ( measure angle between trunk vector and knee vector )

New Idea:
could film exercise from the front , but at some point keypoints are  not visible ...

film bicep curl from 45 degree angle, so that both arms can be detected

TRICEPS:
1) detect angle between forearm and upperarm (upArm_forearm_angles)
2) detect angle between upperarm and trunk (upArm_trunk_angles)
3) detect angle between trunk and knee vector (trunk_knee_angles) 



film from the side


SEATED SHOULDER PRESS:
1) detect angles between forearms and upperarms (upArm_forearm_angles)
2) detect angles between upperarms and trunk (upArm_trunk_angles)

film from the front

FRONT RAISE:
1) angle between forearms and upperarms (upArm_forearm_angleS)
2) angle between upperarms and trunk (upArm_trunk_angles)

could film at 45 degree angle to detect both arms

Machine Learning Model: Knn Dtw

1) Dataset of 1 reps for each exercise 

save each rep as np array

IDEA: 
could have one dataset for each exercises
pandas Dataframe: 
Bicep | Label       Front Raise | Label        Shoulders | Label      Triceps | Label

a function that takes folder with video keypoints 

for each video:
    get y_label for each video from video name (correct, incorrect) 
    store each angle array untill local max (extract each rep) 
    create a dictionary (angle array : y_label) 
    add angle arrays to dataframe(ex: Bicep | Label)
    
    
-1 video : 
- 3 arrays of angles; each array has y_label (correct:0, or incorrect:1) 





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Videos:

bicep_correct_5,6,7 -  person in the background, points are not clear
all points are with num_people_max 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset:
Some nan values present in dataset due to obscured keypoints(probably)
replaced them with 0s

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keypoints:
Some keypoint folder names are messed up
