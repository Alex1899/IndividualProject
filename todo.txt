TODO
BICEP:
1) can detect if traps are shrugged excessively. (measure angle between shoulder vectors neck vectors)
2) can detect if the hips are thrown forward/backwards ( measure angle between trunk vector and knee vector )

New Idea:
could film exercise from the front , but at some point keypoints are  not visible ...

film bicep curl from 45 degree angle, so that both arms can be detected

TRICEPS:
1) detect angle between forearm and upperarm
2) detect angle between upperarm and trunk
3) detect angle between trunk and knee vector (hips forward) 

film from the side


SEATED SHOULDER PRESS:
1) detect angles between forearms and upperarms
2) detect angles between upperarms and trunk

film from the front

FRONT RAISE:
1) angle between forearms and upperarms
2) angle between upperarms and trunk

could film at 45 degree angle to detect both arms
