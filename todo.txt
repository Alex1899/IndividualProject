TODO
BICEP:
1) can detect if traps are shrugged excessively. (measure angle between shoulder vectors neck vectors)
2) can detect if the hips are thrown forward/backwards ( measure angle between trunk vector and knee vector )

New Idea:
could film exercise from the front , but at some point keypoints are  not visible ...
